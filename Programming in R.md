- Considered top 10 desirable professional skill (Forbes.com)


Preperation
========================================================


```r
#install.packages("traits")
require(traits)

#install.packages("oce")
require(oce)
```




"For" loops
========================================================


```r
for(i in 1:10){
  print(i)
}
```

```
[1] 1
[1] 2
[1] 3
[1] 4
[1] 5
[1] 6
[1] 7
[1] 8
[1] 9
[1] 10
```

"For" loops
========================================================


```r
sentence <- NULL
for(words in c("This","does","not yet appear",
           "to be useful")){
  sentence <- paste(sentence,words)
}
print(sentence)
```

```
[1] " This does not yet appear to be useful"
```


"For" loops
========================================================

Get data for multiple coral species
